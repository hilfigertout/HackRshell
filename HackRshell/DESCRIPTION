Maintainer: Ian Roberts <ijr2399@gmail.com>
Description: This library implements a reverse shell program in R.
    An attacker starts by running the server() function inside. Then,
    when a target runs the client() function, the target's R session
    will attempt to connect to the server and listen for commands to run.
    See the HackRshell manual page for the list of commands.
